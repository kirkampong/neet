# Given an array of DISTINCT ints, return all possible permutations. 
# You can return the answer in any order.
# Approach:
#   - We could simply use itertools above for n! solutions
#   - We will use a decision tree with backtracking approach
#         Input:    [1,2,3]
#                  /   |   \
#              [2,3] [1,3]  [1,2]
#              /  \   /  \    /  \
#            [3] [2] [3] [1] [2] [1]
#   - Each step down the tree we are choosing to remove one element
#     until we get to the single entry base case
#   - In backtracking upwards we append the removed element at the end
#   - When we reach the end we add the list to our results
#
# Complexity:
#   - O(n * n!) time , O(n!) space
#   - There are n! perms for array of length n. For each permutation, 
#         we need to make n calls to get to the leaves 
def permute(nums):
  result = []
  # base case
  if len(nums) == 1:
    # return a copy so as not to get caught up in a call
    # by reference problem, we want to pass these on by value
    return [nums[:]]
  
  for i in range(len(nums)):
    #moving down: remove first elem and permute rest
    n = nums.pop(0)
    perms = permute(nums)
    # back track: append removed value to perm(subproblem)
    for perm in perms:
      perm.append(n)
    result.extend(perms)

# Given a list of nums that may contain DUPLICATES, return all possible 
# unique permutations in any order.
# Approach:
#   - We will solve with backtracking like above, but make adjustments
#   - To avoid duplicates, instead of using the array in our decision tree,
#         we will use a hashmap to avoid 'identical children' in our tree
#   - At each decision level our children will be UNIQUE hashmap keys,
#         Counts will track how many times we can use each element
# Complexity:
#   - Might be O(n * 2^n) or n! at worst, not sure
# SHORTCUT: append this to permutations I solutions:
#   - Return list([list(y) for y in (set([tuple(x) for x in perm1solution])]) 

# Solution 1:
def permute(nums):
  result = []
  perm = [] #To build each permutation
  count = {num:0 for num in nums} #Fill hashmap keys
  for num in nums:
    count[num] += 1 #Fill hashmap values

# ie; return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.
# eg: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo" => True
# Approach
#   - Instead of getting bogged down by permutations, think anagrams
#   - Using a sliding window check every window in s2 of size s1 O(n*m)
#   - We can get O(26n) if all chars are lowercase, we hashmaps:
#        Maintain a hashmap for s1 and one for currWindow in s2
#   - Even better we get O(n) by using 2 hashmaps like above:
#       - Maintain a 'matches[0-26]' variable to track the number of matches
#         of each char between the 2 hashmaps across ascii 'a-z'
#       - As we slide our window, update hashmap_s2 and matches[26]
